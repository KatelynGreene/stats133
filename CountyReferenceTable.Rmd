Reading in reference table concerning county information **FROM 2010**
Source: https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/codes/cou.html

```{r}
#Note: colClasses = "character" helps keep the leading 0s
df <- read.table("https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/codes/files/national_county.txt", sep = ",", col.names = c("State", "StateFIPS", "CountyFIPS", "CountyName", "ClassFIPSCode" ), colClasses = "character", quote = "")

#summary(df)

#Shannon County (46-113) change to Oglala Lakota County (46-102) (Effective 2015)
df2 <- data.frame(State = "SD", StateFIPS = "46", CountyFIPS = "102", CountyName = "Oglala Lakota County", ClassFIPSCode = "H1")
df <- rbind(df, df2)


#Merge state and county into one FIPS code
df <- df %>% mutate(FIPS = paste(StateFIPS, CountyFIPS, sep = ""))

#summary(df4)
#View(df4)

#Minimal dataframe to facilitate joins
df_compact <- df %>% select(c(CountyName, FIPS))
