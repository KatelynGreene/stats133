Reading-in data on educational attainment from 1974-2015. Original source: https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/CountyLevel_Data_Sets_Download_Data__18026/Education.xls?v=42762

Note file had to be downloaded first and then read-in as there appears to be no easy way to directly read-in a xlsx file from a URL.

Ultimately had to download excel file, delete excess info at the top, save as csv, then read.csv()
```{r}
library(xlsx)
library(RCurl)

#URL <- getURLContent("https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/CountyLevel_Data_Sets_Download_Data__18026/Education.xls?v=42762")

#data <- read.xlsx("C:\\Users\\Katrlyn\\Downloads\\Education.xls", sheetIndex = 1)

data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Katrlyn\\Downloads\\Education.csv")
head(data)
```
