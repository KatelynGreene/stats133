Reading-in data on educational attainment from 1974-2015. Original source: https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/CountyLevel_Data_Sets_Download_Data__18026/Education.xls?v=42762

Note file had to be downloaded first and then read-in as there appears to be no easy way to directly read-in a xlsx file from a URL.

Ultimately had to download excel file, delete excess info at the top, save as csv, then read.csv()
```{r}
library(RCurl)
library(readxl)
library(mosaic)
library(readr)

#No Luck using getURLContent but would like to pursue
#URL <- getURLContent("https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/CountyLevel_Data_Sets_Download_Data__18026/Education.xls?v=42762")


#Works but the issue is that file must be handled locally during preprocessing.
download.file("https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/CountyLevel_Data_Sets_Download_Data__18026/Education.xls?v=42762", destfile = "C:\\Users\\Katrlyn\\Downloads\\edu.xls", mode = "wb" )

data <- read_excel("C:\\Users\\Katrlyn\\Downloads\\edu.xls", sheet = 1, skip = 4)

#read_file() can't find xls finle extension
#data <- read_excel(read_file("https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/CountyLevel_Data_Sets_Download_Data__18026/Education.xls?v=42762"), sheet = 1, skip = 4)


#Try tempfile
#excelData <- tempfile(fileext = ".xls")
#download.file(url = "https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/CountyLevel_Data_Sets_Download_Data__18026/Education.xls", destfile = excelData)

#df <- read_excel(excelData, sheet = 1, skip = 4)
 
```

```{r}

#Note that there is data for: US,  states, AND counties.
#Should be able to filter by FIPS code to help isolate what we want (those that end in 0 are not counties)
head(data)
```

```{r}
dog <- read.csv("https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/CountyLevel_Data_Sets_Download_Data__18026/Education.xls?v=42762")
head(dog)
